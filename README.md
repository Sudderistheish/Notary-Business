# Notary-Business

I will be building a sales and company information for the website.
I will crate java script.
I will set up color and backround.
Information will include company name, contact information, services provided, hours of operation, and sales records.

## Collaboration with my accountability partners.
Nashville Location product 
Sales from 6 am to 7:pm
Need Minimum to Maximum of total sales
We have to calculate and store the cookies per hour
We have to calculate the average number of cookies per hour
Location	Min / Cust	Max / Cust	Avg Cookie / Sale
Seattle	23	65	6.3
Tokyo	3	24	1.2
  Math to use would be variable that would indicate how many customers
Customers = rand (23,65);  //30
Sales6am = 6.3*customer6am //189
Sales 6am = 6.3 * customers 6am  ( use a function that will create a random number and store it in the varible

6.3 (65-23) +23

Total is going to be 875 possibly,  we are just trying to figure out the code.
Possible code will be 
Objects
function getRandomInt(min, max) {
min = Math.cell(min) =
max = Math.floor(max);
return Math.floor(math.random() * (max-min) + min);
//The Maximum is exclusive and the minimum is inclusive
}
let  x = getRandomint(23, 65)
console.log(“getRandomInt”)
